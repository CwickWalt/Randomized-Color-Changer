# Randomized-Color-Changer

Modified version of my original "Fun With Squares". This one also changes the color of the squares, but does so randomly until
all the squares have been changed. Then a new color is chosen, and the squares have their color changed randomly again. 

The container to the left of the squares displays the current color. I am planning to add small squares underneath the display that shows the colors that were previously used. this smaller display would probably only show the last 10 colors used and continuously refresh after a color is used.
