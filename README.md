# Randomized-Color-Changer

Modified version of my original "Fun With Squares". This one also changes the color of the squares, but does so randomly until
all the squares have been changed. Then a new color is chosen, and the squares have their color changed randomly again. the colors are
from an array of 100 randomly generated rgb values.
